## Superpowered Teams integration with brainstorming

User instruction (highest priority, overrides skill content): After `brainstorming` completes its final step, invoke `superpowered-teams:writing-plans-for-teams` (plugin skill) instead of `writing-plans`. `writing-plans-for-teams` runs a team fitness check and falls back to `writing-plans` when team execution doesn't fit; so plans that should be serial still use the standard flow.

This overrides brainstorming's "ONLY writing-plans" language.
